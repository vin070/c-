**Print Permutations**\

Given an input string (STR), print all possible permutations of the input string.\
**Note** : The input string may contain the same characters, so there will also be the same permutations.
The order of permutations doesnâ€™t matter.

**INPUT FORMAT**\
The only input line contains a string (STR) of alphabets in lower case

**OUTPUT FORMAT**\
Print each permutations in a new line\
**Note** : You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the function.**

**CONSTRAINTS**\
1<=length of STR<=8\
Time Limit: 1sec

**SAMPLE INPUT**\
cba

**SAMPLE OUTPUT**\
abc\
acb\
bac\
bca\
cab\
cba

**TIME COMPLEXITY**\
T(n) = O(2^n) where n is length of string
