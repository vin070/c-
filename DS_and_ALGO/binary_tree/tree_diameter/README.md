**Find diameter of binary tree**

Diameter of binary tree is longest distance between any two node. For single node diameter will be 0.

**SAMPLE INPUT 1**
```
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
```

**SAMPLE OUTPUT 1**\
4

**SAMPLE INPUT 2**
```
-1
```

**SAMPLE OUTPUT 2**\
0

**TIME COMPLEXITY**\
T(n) = O(n) where n is number of node in tree

**SPACE COMPLEXITY**\
S(n) = O(n) where n is number of node in tree
